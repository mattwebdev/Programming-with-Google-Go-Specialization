# bin Directory

The `bin` directory is used to store compiled executable files. When you build your Go programs, the resulting binary executables will be placed here. This directory is typically in your `GOPATH` and serves the following purposes:

- Stores executable binaries after compilation
- Makes compiled programs easily accessible from the command line
- Keeps binaries separate from source code

Note: This directory is automatically managed by Go's build system. You typically don't need to manually add files here, as they will be created when you build your Go programs using `go install` or similar commands.
