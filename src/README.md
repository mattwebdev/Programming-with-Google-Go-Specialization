# src Directory

The `src` directory is where all your Go source code lives. This is the most important directory in your Go workspace and serves the following purposes:

- Contains all source code files (`.go` files)
- Organizes code into packages and projects
- Follows Go's package naming conventions
- Houses third-party packages (when using GOPATH)

Directory structure within `src` typically follows this pattern:
```
src/
    github.com/username/project/
    example.com/company/project/
    your-project/
        pkg1/
        pkg2/
```

Note: While modern Go projects often use Go modules and don't strictly require this directory structure, maintaining this organization can still be beneficial for code organization and compatibility with older Go tools.
